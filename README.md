# Hi there, I'm Vishaalini! 👋

**Aspiring Data Scientist | AI/ML Developer | Research Enthusiast**

I’m a motivated data science professional with a strong academic foundation and hands-on experience in machine learning, AI systems, and applied research. Passionate about leveraging intelligent algorithms to create real-world impact, I specialize in building scalable data-driven solutions, multilingual AI tools, and interactive models for image segmentation and semantic search.

With research experience from Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), USA, and industry exposure from Kovai.Co, I aim to bridge the gap between theoretical innovation and practical application. Currently pursuing an MSc in Computer Science—Data Science at Trinity College Dublin, I'm eager to contribute to projects that push the boundaries of AI and data science.
